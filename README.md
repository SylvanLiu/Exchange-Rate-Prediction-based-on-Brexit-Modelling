# ExchangeRatePrediction

Firstly, make a rough prediction according to the historical exchange rate data of GBP to EUR.
This has been implemented in tendency_prediction.py, around a Clockwork RNN (Jan Koutn√≠k, 2014).

Secondly, we optimise the rough tendency by involving the model of Brexit events.
The Brexit event data are from https://www.theweek.co.uk/100284/brexit-timeline-key-dates-in-the-uk-s-break-up-with-the-eu
