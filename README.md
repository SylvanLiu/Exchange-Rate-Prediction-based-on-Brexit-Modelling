# ExchangeRatePrediction

Firstly, it makes a rough prediction according to the historical data of the exchange rate of GBP to EUR.
This has been implemented in tendency_prediction.py, according to the Clockwork RNN (Jan Koutn√≠k, 2014) https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3511

The authorised data of exchange rates come from online database https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series (The file 'GBP2EUR.csv is merely an example that shows the shape of the final data we requested from the internet.')

Secondly, it is going to optimise the rough tendency by involving the model of Brexit events.
The Brexit event data 'BREXIT.csv' come from the website https://www.theweek.co.uk/100284/brexit-timeline-key-dates-in-the-uk-s-break-up-with-the-eu (This part is still in progress.)
