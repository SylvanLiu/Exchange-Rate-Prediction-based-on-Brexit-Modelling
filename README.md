# ExchangeRatePrediction

Project aims to combine the chronological data of Brexit events and EUR as well as GBP exchange rates, build a model to analyse in what tendency will Brexit events impact on the exchange rates. And subsequently make a prediction to the exchange rates trend during the UK general election on December 12.

Firstly, it makes a rough prediction according to the historical exchange rate data of GBP to EUR.
This has been implemented in tendency_prediction.py, around a Clockwork RNN (Jan Koutn√≠k, 2014) https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3511

The authorised data of exchange rates come from online database https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DEXUSUK and https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DEXUSEU (The file 'GBP2EUR.csv is merely an example that shows the shape of the final data we requested from the internet.')

Secondly, it is going to optimise the rough tendency by involving the model of Brexit events.
The Brexit event data 'BREXIT.csv' come from the website https://www.theweek.co.uk/100284/brexit-timeline-key-dates-in-the-uk-s-break-up-with-the-eu
